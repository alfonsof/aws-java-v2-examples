# Java examples on AWS (Amazon Web Services) - SDK V2

This repo contains Java code examples on AWS (Amazon Web Services).

These examples show how to use Java 8 and AWS SDK for Java (SDK V2) in order to manage Amazon services on AWS.

If you have to use AWS SDK for Java (SDK V1) you have the Java code examples on AWS following this link: [https://github.com/alfonsof/aws-java-examples/](https://github.com/alfonsof/aws-java-examples)

AWS SDK for Java allows Java developers to write software that makes use of Amazon services like EC2, S3 and Lambda functions.

## Quick start

You must have an [AWS (Amazon Web Services)](http://aws.amazon.com/) account.

The code for the samples is contained in individual folders on this repository.

For instructions on running the code, please consult the README in each folder.

This is the list of examples:
